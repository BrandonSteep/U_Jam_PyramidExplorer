  - '~ Chapter One ~


    Stepping into the Lion''s Den'
  - 'Her car was busted, it was late at night, and she was far, far from home.


    She
    could barely even hear her own sobbing over the hammering of the rain against
    the windshield.'
  - 'But thank the heavens - she found solace!


    A large building stood proud,
    welcoming her in with its foreign allure. Perhaps she could ask for help? Maybe
    they''d have a phone to call home? Possibly even a shower to help her regain
    her senses?'
  - 'But something was off.


    She didn''t know it until it was too late.


    Stepping
    through the echoing halls, considering her surroundings, noticing the lack of
    human presence, the sour taste, the twisting knots in the air.'
  - 'Her stomach turned itself upside down when she found herself reading a dusty
    old book, which seemed to describe this very night.


    No. You''re not going
    mad. You shouldn''t have come here.'
  - Bang.
